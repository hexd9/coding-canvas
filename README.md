Description
The Horiseon Marketing Agency website was in need of a refactoring project to improve its accessibility features. The goal of this project was to ensure that the website met all accessibility standards and, at the same time, had proper semantic structure in the HTML file. During the project I improved the website's accessibility for users with disabilities by adding alt attributes which described images in detail. In addition, the refactored HTML file will now make it simple to maintain the code in the future. During this project, I broke down the existing HTML file and updated it with proper semantic structure. This involved updating non-semantic HTML elements with semantic HTML elements. I also reorganized the CSS style sheet to follow the HTML's semantic structure. This will make it easier to maintain the website in the future when updates are needed. Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in analyzing an existing an HTML file and updating it with proper semantic structure while learning from the existing code created by another developer.

I used this page as a reference for my HTML. https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/html/html-cheatsheet Did some research on how to add a description to the header element to ensure accessibility standards are met (aria-label). https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label I used this existing README.md to view how others create a README.md and as a reference. https://github.com/microsoft/vscode I used this page as a guideline when creating my README.md. https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide
